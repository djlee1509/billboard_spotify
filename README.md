# Billboard Spotify

Billboard Spotify is the script to scrape the list of top 100 songs on Billboard chart then, add tracks to the playlist.

e.g. url: https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/2021-04-20

It will scrape the top 100 tracks on the date 20/04/21 then, add tracks to the private playlist.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## What I have learned
- Python scraping using Beautiful Soup
- Spotify Authentication (OAuth) using OAuth - it was challenging.
